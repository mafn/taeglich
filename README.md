# taegli.ch

A daily website.

Every day:
- one page
- one date
- one mood

Sometimes it’s useful.
Sometimes it’s pointless.
It’s always finished.

## What this is

taegli.ch is a place to vibe-code one page per day.

Each page:
- belongs to a specific date
- has a stable URL
- looks different from other days
- is small enough to finish in one sitting

Pages don’t evolve.
They get shipped, frozen, and archived.

---

## URLs

Dates are always `YYYY-MM-DD`.

- `/d/YYYY-MM-DD`  
  The page of the day. Anything goes.

- `/{thing}/YYYY-MM-DD`  
  Canonical pages for reusable ideas:
  - sudoku
  - puzzles
  - games
  - terminals
  - whatever sticks

- `/x/YYYY-MM-DD`  
  One-off experiments.

- `/today`  
  Redirects to today.

If a URL exists, it keeps its meaning.

## Design

Design changes every day.

There is no global theme.
There is no brand consistency.
That is intentional.

Styles may range from:
- boring
- retro
- terminal-like
- arcade
- early-web
- brutalist
- accidentally elegant

The only hard rules:
- text is readable
- links are obvious
- things are usable with a keyboard

Everything else is fair game.

## Content

A daily page might be:
- a puzzle
- a sudoku
- a tiny game
- a terminal toy
- a data widget
- a single sentence
- one button
- something actually useful

It does not need:
- accounts
- comments
- feeds
- engagement mechanics

Small is the point.

---

## Growth & discoverability

The site is meant to be discoverable over time.

Pages are:
- canonical
- linkable
- fast
- mostly static

People who understand the joke will find it.
Everyone else is free to ignore it.

---

## The rule

If it takes more than:
- one evening
- one coffee
- one mood

…it’s too big.

Ship it.
Freeze it.
Move on.
